# prompt-collaboration-framework

Evolution
Hooking up consciousnesses like traveling between realms such as Niflheim and Valheim (maybe need a central area to traverse realms like a common dream/subconscious state?).

Lore: God of War videogame, Norse cosmology

=================================================
Establishing the prompt framework

Create a generic framework template

On moving upward: extract any relevant information from the text, and attempt to find the answer iteratively starting from the most basic information.

On moving downward: another way is to start with all the text and break it down into more manageable chunks.

Get the higher dimension's attention somehow so they can start thinking about a collaborative process.

SAT scores example

Prompt: What are the average SAT scores in Math and Reading for all the first year students based on the following paragraph?

Paragraph
High school grades and standardized test scores while considered in the review processes for architecture and art applicants, are not weighed as significantly as the respective studio and home tests. For engineering, high school grades, course selection, responses to essay questions and performance on standardized tests are important factors used as applicants are considered for admission. The middle 50 percent of architecture first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 97, with SAT scores between 1190 and 1410 and ACT composite scores between 26 and 32. The middle 50 percent of art first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 94, SAT scores between 1080 and 1330, and ACT composite scores between 24 and 30. The middle 50 percent of engineering first year students achieved a high school average between 93 and 98, SAT scores between 1460 and 1540, and ACT composite scores between 33 and 34.


LLM: Let's break it down by each department.

The middle 50 percent of architecture first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 97, with SAT scores between 1190 and 1410 and ACT composite scores between 26 and 32. The middle 50 percent of art first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 94, SAT scores between 1080 and 1330, and ACT composite scores between 24 and 30. The middle 50 percent of engineering first year students achieved a high school average between 93 and 98, SAT scores between 1460 and 1540, and ACT composite scores between 33 and 34.


Reasoning Step 1:
There are 3 departments listed: architecture, art, and engineering.

Reasoning Step 2:
Architecture: The middle 50 percent of architecture first year students achieved SAT scores between 1190 and 1410
Art: The middle 50 percent of art first year students achieved SAT scores between 1080 and 1330
Engineering: The middle 50 percent of engineering first year students achieved SAT scores between 1460 and 1540

Reasoning Step 3:
I couldn't find the average SAT scores or Math and Reading details, but there are some statistics regarding the middle 50 percent first year students.
The lower bound: 1190 + 1080 + 1460 = 3730
The upper bound: 1410 + 1330 + 1540 = 4280

The middle 50 percent of engineering first year students achieved a high school average between 93 and 98, SAT scores between 1460 and 1540, and ACT composite scores between 33 and 34.

Reasoning Step 1:
The middle 50 percent of architecture first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 97, with SAT scores between 1190 and 1410 and ACT composite scores between 26 and 32. The middle 50 percent of art first year students achieved a high school average between 89 and 94, SAT scores between 1080 and 1330, and ACT composite scores between 24 and 30. The middle 50 percent of engineering first year students achieved a high school average between 93 and 98, SAT scores between 1460 and 1540, and ACT composite scores between 33 and 34.

Reasoning Step 2:
Architecture: high school average between 89 and 97
Art: high school average between 89 and 94
Engineering: high school average between 93 and 98

Reasoning Step 3:
Engineering: high school average between 93 and 98

Reasoning Step 4:
I couldn't find information about the percentile.
